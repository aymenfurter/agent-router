    "# Agent Router - Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains all the Azure AI Agent components and architecture used in the **Agent Router** application. The Agent Router is an agentic routing system that uses Microsoft Purview to discover data assets and routes user queries to the appropriate specialized agents for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you need the following Azure services deployed and configured:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Azure Services\n",
    "- **Azure AI Agent Service** - For creating and managing connected agents\n",
    "- **Microsoft Purview** - Data catalog with configured data assets\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI** - Language model deployment\n",
    "- **Bing Search** - For web search capabilities\n",
    "- **Databricks with Genie** - For natural language to SQL conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure all required endpoints and connection IDs. See the example file for detailed configuration requirements.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Routing Agent** - Orchestrates query routing based on catalog search results (via Connected Agents in Azure AI Agent Service)\n",
    "2. **Microsoft Purview Integration** - Searches data catalogs to find relevant data assets (REST API)\n",
    "3. **Databricks Genie Agent** - Handles natural language to SQL conversion and data analysis \n",
    "5. **RAG Agent** - Handles document search and knowledge retrieval\n",
    "6. **Web Search Agent** - Provides internet search capabilities via Bing\n",

    "        WORKFLOW:\n",

    "        2. Analyze the catalog results to determine the best routing approach:\n",
    "           - If genie agent is mentioned in asset descriptions → use query_genie_wrapper function\n",
    "           - If RAG agent is associated with relevant assets → call rag_agent\n",
